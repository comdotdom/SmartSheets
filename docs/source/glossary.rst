   Dashboards
   Sights
      Smartsheet Dashboards are a collection of widgets that can contain data
      from a variety of different data sources (for example, sheets, reports, or custom data).

      Dashboards were once called Sights(TM) and this name is still present in
      object names, endpoint paths, and other places.

   Cross-sheet References
      A named range in another sheet that is being used in the current sheet.

   Lineage
      The source of the data.
      In Data Governance circles this term is used to describe gaining an understanding of the whole
      supply chain for a piece of data.

      e.g. Knowing that the item on a report came from a view on a table
      in a data warehouse which got its data from the operational system of the company.
